# Voting - Common Election Data Format Project

This repository holds common election data format and related information and files that are being created by NIST and collaborators.  It currently hold the draft NIST specification for elections results reporting.

NIST's common election data format project has the goal of (a) specifying a common, XML-based import/export format for election devices such as electronic pollbooks, election management systems, and vote capture devices, and (b) specifying a comprehensive foundational UML model that will cover election data in general.  The model defines the various objects (e.g., candidates, contests, offices, etc.) and their associated attributes, and specifies the relationships between and among the objects.  It includes a glossary and other tools to ensure that the implementations of the model (i.e., the XML formats) are consistent in style, definition, and composition.

NIST is in the process of populating this repository with the draft NIST specification for election results reporting, including the XML schema, UML model, the specification document, and example files.
